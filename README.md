# Machine-Learning-Model-Deployment-Using-Flask 


The Machine-Learning-Model-Deployment-Using-Flask project aims to provide a web-based solution for predicting medical insurance costs. The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset of medical insurance costs and building a Flask application to deploy the model.

The Flask application will take input parameters such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, and use the trained machine learning model to predict the medical insurance cost. The user will be able to interact with the web application through a user-friendly interface, providing input data and receiving a predicted insurance cost.

The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, building the Flask application, and deploying the application on a web server. The goal is to build a robust and scalable web application that can handle multiple user requests and provide accurate insurance cost predictions.

This project has practical applications in the healthcare industry, where accurate predictions of medical insurance costs can help insurance providers and healthcare organizations make informed decisions about insurance coverage and healthcare resource allocation. Additionally, this project can serve as a template for other machine learning model deployment projects using Flask.


*  USAGE of the Flask we server
To see the prediction of Insurance cost, we are going to run this app using a terminal. Firstly, open our terminal (Linux) or CMD in Windows and export the FLASK_APP env variable with our main Python script nameâ€” app.

This is how our Insurance Cost Predictor app works!
